## AWS Services

### S3

* High durability.
* Low cost (orders-of-magnitude less than any other storage option on AWS).
* Keyspace partitioning by prefix (e.g. pseudo-directories).
* Sorted keyspace retrieval.

### DynamoDB

* Conditional puts and updates -- allows for compare-and-set.
* Ordered traversal via indexes.

## Design Ideas

### Naive Approaches

* Implement crux's KV store on S3, and use a Moberg TxLog atop that. Use SQS with
  S3 notifications to pause a polling event consumer. Based on the "standalone"
  topology in crux.

* Implement an atomic counter on DynamoDB, and use this to push events into S3,
  indexed by event ID generated by this counter. Again use SQS to pause a polling
  event consumer.
